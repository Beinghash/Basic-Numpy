# Data Analysis Series: Basic NumPy

This section of the "Data Analysis" series focuses on introducing **NumPy**, a fundamental library for numerical computing in Python. NumPy provides powerful tools for handling arrays and matrices, along with a wide range of mathematical and statistical operations. The following topics will guide you through the core concepts and functionalities of NumPy to enhance your data analysis skills.

### ✅ **Basic NumPy Arrays**
In this section, we explore the foundational building blocks of NumPy operations – the **NumPy array**. Arrays form the core structure for storing and manipulating data in NumPy, and understanding their properties and functions is crucial for efficient data analysis.

### ✅ **Array Types**
Learn about the different **data types** available in NumPy arrays, such as integers, floats, and more. We'll also delve into the importance of choosing the right data type for performance and memory optimization.

### ✅ **Dimensions & Shape**
Working with **multi-dimensional arrays** is essential for handling more complex datasets. This section covers how to manipulate the dimensions and shape of NumPy arrays, including reshaping, transposing, and accessing array elements in different dimensions.

### ✅ **Indexing & Slicing Matrices**
Efficiently accessing and manipulating data within arrays is vital. In this section, we explore **indexing** and **slicing** techniques, allowing you to extract, modify, and organize data in matrices and higher-dimensional arrays.

### ✅ **Summary Statistics**
Perform **descriptive statistical analysis** using NumPy. We cover basic statistical operations like mean, median, standard deviation, and other summary functions, empowering you to understand and interpret your data quickly.

### ✅ **Boolean Arrays**
In this section, you’ll learn how to filter and perform condition-based operations with **boolean arrays**. These powerful tools enable efficient data selection and manipulation based on specific conditions or criteria.

### ✅ **Memory Size of Objects**
An important aspect of working with large datasets is understanding how data is stored in memory. This section explains the **memory size of NumPy objects**, helping you optimize memory usage and enhance performance in data-intensive operations.

### ✅ **Useful NumPy Functions**
Here, we introduce a selection of **handy NumPy functions** that can speed up your data analysis tasks. These functions simplify complex operations, providing shortcuts for common tasks and improving your workflow.
